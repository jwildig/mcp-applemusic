## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- macOS with Apple Music app installed
- MCP library ≥1.2.1

## Installation

First, ensure you have uv installed:
```bash
$ brew install uv
```

Then, with **Claude Desktop**, add the following to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iTunesControlServer": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["-n", "mcp-applemusic"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Commands

The following commands are available through the MCP server:

```python
itunes_play()         # Start playback
itunes_pause()        # Pause playback
itunes_next()         # Skip to next track
itunes_previous()     # Go to previous track

itunes_play_song(song, artist)  # Play specific song
itunes_create_playlist(name, songs)  # Create new playlist
